# Pizza-Store-Analysis
The Maven Plato pizza dataset consists of 4 CSV files containing a year's worth of sales data from a fictional pizza restaurant. The files include details about the date and time of each order, the pizzas served, along with information on the type, size, quantity, price, and ingredients of each pizza. Please note that this is a guided project.

# Questions We Answer
1. what days and times do we tend to be busiest?
2. How many pizzas are we making during peak periods?
3. what are our best and worst selling pizzas?
4. what is our average order value?

# Tools used
Power B: Microsoft's business intelligence tool, was extremely useful in my visualization process. I imported the datasets into Power BI and developed a dashboard that is both clear and visually engaging.
